# huggingface_typo_experiment
# Project Overview
This repository presents an experiment on a method developed to detect impersonation attacks, specifically typosquatting, within model hubs such as Hugging Face. Our study focuses on three key aspects of model hubs: models, datasets, and organizations. Different methods are applied to each aspect, including Levenshtein distance, the SequenceMatcher function from the difflib package, and quantitative analysis.
